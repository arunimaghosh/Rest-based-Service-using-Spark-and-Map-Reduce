Input To Reducer <zipcodetype,city, state>
Output of Reducer <zipcodetype,city, count>
Output mapper  <zipcodetype city , state>
In Mapper phase : input will be read from the tables and key will be the group by columns and value will be the value of column on which aggregation is to be applied
Mapper phase output <value of groupby columns, column value on which aggregation is to be applied>
In Reducer phase :  input <value of groupby columns, column value on which aggregation is to be applied> and output <groupby columns values,aggregate function value>
